## **Pre-requisites**

To complete this exam, you must have the following tools installed on your system:

* **GitHub account** (for hosting your solution)
* **[K3D](https://k3d.io/stable/)** (to set up a local Kubernetes cluster)
* **[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)** (for Python dependency management)

## **Environment Setup**

### **GitHub Setup**

1. Unzip the exam folder:

```bash
unzip platform-engineer-test.zip
```

2. Create a dedicated **Git repository** under your GitHub account and push the contents of the extracted folder.

### **Local Kubernetes Cluster Setup**

1. Install your local Kubernetes cluster using  **K3D** :

```bash
k3d cluster create -c k3d-config.yaml --registry-config k3d-registries.yaml
```

2. Wait for all cluster components to be ready:

```bash
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces --watch
```

Your environment is considered **ready** once you see output similar to:

```json
kube-system   coredns-7b98449c4-z64bm                   1/1     Running     0          15m
kube-system   helm-install-traefik-bt6wp                0/1     Completed   2          15m
kube-system   helm-install-traefik-crd-82nw6            0/1     Completed   0          15m
kube-system   local-path-provisioner-595dcfc56f-6lmpf   1/1     Running     0          15m

kube-system   svclb-traefik-97509331-m4ltx              2/2     Running     0          15m
kube-system   svclb-traefik-97509331-p7vmm              2/2     Running     0          15m

^C%  
```

### **Local Registry Setup**

1. Add the following entry to `/etc/hosts`:

```json
127.0.0.1 my-registry.local
```

2. Verify that the local Docker registry is running:

```ini
docker ps | grep registry
```

Expected output:

```json
69b0319f571f   registry:2   "/entrypoint.sh /etc…"   Up 15 minutes   0.0.0.0:59462->5000/tcp   my-registry
```

## **Exam Tasks**

1. **Install ArgoCD** in your local cluster in the `argocd` namespace.
2. **Deploy Nginx as an ArgoCD-managed application** in a GitOps manner.
   * Store the **Nginx manifests** in your Git repository.
   * Store the **ArgoCD application manifest** in Git.

3. **Develop a FastAPI service** that interacts with ArgoCD.
   * Implement two **API endpoints** to list **ArgoCD applications** and  **ArgoCD projects** .
